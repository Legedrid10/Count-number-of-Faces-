Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV and Dlib

Description: Developed an advanced real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Dlib libraries in Python. The system captures video from the computer's default camera, processes each frame to detect faces, and visually highlights each detected face with bounding boxes and labels.

Responsibilities:

Video Capture and Processing: Utilized OpenCV to access the computer's default camera, capture video frames, and convert these frames from color to grayscale to optimize face detection.
Face Detection: Implemented dlib’s frontal face detector to identify and locate faces within the video frames efficiently.
Real-Time Display: Designed the system to process and display video frames in real-time, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces and labeling them with unique identifiers.
User Interaction: Enabled the system to respond to user inputs, allowing the program to exit cleanly when the user presses the 'q' key.
Key Features:

Efficient Frame Processing: Achieved real-time performance by converting frames to grayscale and leveraging dlib's highly optimized face detection algorithms.
Accurate Face Localization: Precisely located faces in the video feed and drew rectangles around them, making the system highly reliable in detecting multiple faces simultaneously.
Dynamic Labeling: Implemented a dynamic labeling system to number and display each detected face, providing clear identification even when multiple faces are present.
User-Friendly Interface: Integrated OpenCV’s functions to ensure that the graphical interface was intuitive, with real-time updates and easy termination using keyboard input.
Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, Dlib
